Neighbourhood Map
=================

This project displays a number of beaches in the Auckland area on a Google Map. 
To display the location of all beaches, click on the button labeled "Show all" or simply click on a beach that interests you from the list on the right hand side. 
You can also search a beach from the list by typing in the search box at the top. 

Markers are placed on the map for the beaches. Each of those markers contain further information that is being collected from Wikipedia. 

All images are taken from Flickr and are displayed in a random order.
